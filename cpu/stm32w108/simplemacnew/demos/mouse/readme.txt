This is a demo to show how to implement an RF mouse based on MEMS movement detection.
There are two configuration _TX it is the mouse which will send the movement and buttons events to the _RX connected using USB to PC.

Basic instructions
------------------
Basic information are:
Left click (S1 or S2)
Right Click (S3 or S4)
Mouse movement, tilt the mouse in a direction and the speed of the mouse will be proportional to the tilt angle.
In particular:
- Tilting towards ground will move mouse down
- Tilting towards ceiling will move mouse up
- Tilting left will move mouse left
- Tilting right will move mouse right
