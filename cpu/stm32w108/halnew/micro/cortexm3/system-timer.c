/** @file hal/micro/cortexm3/system-timer.c
 * @brief STM32W108 System Timer HAL functions.
 * 
 * \b NOTE:  The Sleep Timer count and compare registers are only 16 bits, but
 * the counter and comparators themselves are actually 32bits.  To deal with
 * this, there are High ("H") and Low ("L") registers.  The High register is
 * the "action" register.  When working with SLEEPTMR_CNT, reading the "H"
 * register will return the upper 16 bits and simultaneously trigger the
 * capture of the lower 16bits in the "L" register.  The "L" register may then
 * be read.  When working with the SLEEPTMR_CMP registers, writing "L" will
 * set a shadow register.  Writing "H" will cause the value from the "H" write
 * and the "L" shadow register to be combined and simultaneously loaded into
 * the true 32bit comparator.
